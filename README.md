## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Positioning
- Reactive Design

### What I learned

This challenge was a great learning experience that allowed me to put what I learned into action. I initally attempted to position the QR Code using flexbox. I completed it using CSS positioning. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css

#card {
    width: 300px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    margin: auto;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 15px;
    position: relative;
    top: 250px;
}
```

### Continued development

In upcoming projects I want to focus more on positioning elements using Flexbox and CSS grid. This would be a more optimal approach.
